# Grooves

A React web application that users can log into their Spotify account with, view their favorite artists and tracks on, and receive a customized recommended playlist to save to their account. [Try it out.](https://grooves-app.herokuapp.com/)

# How it was built

Grooves was implemented using the React JavaScript framework, Spotify's Developer APIs, Chakra UI, and FramerMotion.

The Spotify Authorization flow in developing Grooves is the [Implicit Grant Flow](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#implicit-grant-flow), where the authentication is carried out in the client-side.

# The Team

- [Edward](https://www.github.com/epaez1996)

# Takeaways

Developing Grooves was a great learning experience in becoming better React developers. We learned a lot about OAuth and using third-party APIs to create something of our own, as well as using Context to store important global states to help smoothly transition data from page to page.
